# Baby-Gan-Denis-Malimonov

Denis Malimonov's "BabyGAN" is a simplified version of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), designed to be more accessible and easier to understand for beginners in the field of deep learning. Here's a brief description of BabyGAN and an implementation outline:

Description of BabyGAN:
BabyGAN typically consists of two main components:

Generator (G): The generator takes random noise as input and attempts to generate realistic-looking samples. It learns to map the input noise to the data distribution of the training set.

Discriminator (D): The discriminator is a binary classifier that tries to distinguish between real data samples from the training set and fake samples generated by the generator.

The training process of BabyGAN involves a minimax game between the generator and the discriminator. The generator tries to generate samples that are indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify between real and fake samples. Over time, both the generator and discriminator improve their abilities, resulting in more realistic samples generated by the generator.
